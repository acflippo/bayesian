# An Introduction to Bayesian Statistics

This is an introduction on how to use Bayesian Statistics to run a binary outcome A/B test. The notebook **Intro_to_Bayesian_Stats.ipynb** uses PyMC4 for generating samples and probability.  Included in this notebook is some of the most commonly used visualizations for an A/B test.

Additionally, a packaged called **RISE** is included for presenting notebooks using reveal.js-based slideshows in Jupyter Notebook.  For more info, see https://pypi.org/project/rise/.  You can skip installing this package if you do not need to present your code in a slide format.

## Setup

### 1. Create virtual environment
Once the material is on your computer, you'll see that the repository for this course has a file called `environment.yml` that includes a list of all the packages you need
to install. If you run:

```bash
conda env create -f environment.yml
```

This will create a new conda environment called **bayes**.

```bash
conda activate bayes
```

### 2. Setup and launch Jupyter

Next, make Jupyter aware of this new virtual environment. With the `bayes` environment activated, run:

```bash
python -m ipykernel install --user --name bayes
```

That will create what's called a *kernel* in Jupyter linguo (this is just a mirror of your virtual environment).
Then, you can start Jupyter Lab or Notebook to access the materials:

```bash
jupyter lab
```

**When you open any notebook, make sure it's using the right kernel, which will be named `bayes`**. You can check this at the top-right of the Jupyter page.  Select **`bayes`** if you're in another python kernel.

Note: The presentation mode for **RISE** is only available in Jupyter Notebook and not in Jupyter Lab.

Your setup is done.  You can start sampling!
